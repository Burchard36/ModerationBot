# ModerationBot
Was supposed to be a paid project but never received payment so here you go people of github
Special thanks to `Teaxl#2020` For wasting my time!

# How to use the bot

Firstly, you will need to add your bots token into the config.json, You can find a guide of how to get the token through this link: https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/

After that save the file, and start the bot with this command in a cmd.exe file (Or whichever terminal program you work with).

`node index.js`

Afterwards, simply type `-setup` and listen to the bots orders of information it requests, if you need to change information
or entered something incorrectly, simply type `cancel` during setup, or `<your set prerfix>setup` again and the bot will ask for imformation
again.

# Bug reports

Simply open a issue on the discord for any errors the popup in config. I get email notifications for any of my projects.
